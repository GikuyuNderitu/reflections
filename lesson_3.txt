When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local to ensure redundancy and reachability.

Why might I want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
 - I would want to manually pull changes so that I have greater control of the code that's on my machine. so
that I know what exactly I'm running and so that I can make experimental changes that are semi-permanent
without having to branch out

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- I would use a clone when I want to get the full history of a repository into a new location on my machine
where the repository has not already been present
- I would use a branch when I want to experiment off of the main continuity of the code/file. This would allow
the branch to maintain a history contiguous with the history of the main code/file, while still allowing for
play/new ideas
- I would use a fork to get code from a repository that exists elsewhere on GitHub created by someone who I am
not collaborating with, in a situation where I want to publish similar code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the lasat known state of the remote stored locally?
- The user can have a restore point if the local version gets too far afield from the stable version
- The user has access to the totality of the current state of the project.
