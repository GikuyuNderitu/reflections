When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local to ensure redundancy and reachability.

Why might I want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
 - I would want to manually pull changes so that I have greater control of the code that's on my machine. so
that I know what exactly I'm running and so that I can make experiemental changes that are semi-permanent
without having to branch out
